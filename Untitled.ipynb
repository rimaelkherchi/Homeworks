    "The general gas law formula allows you to compare the characteristics of a gas in two different situations. However, this formula is not useful when one wants to determine the characteristics of a gas at a precise moment. We can modify the formula of the general gas law by introducing a constant of proportionality. This constant, symbolized by the letter R, gathers all the constants of the simple gas laws. So, mathematically, we write the ideal gas law as follows:\n",
